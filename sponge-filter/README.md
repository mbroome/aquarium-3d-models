# Sponge Filter

There are 4 available 3d models here meant to upgrade cheap off the shelf sponge filters.  You will typically see these filters availabe under names like 'XY-380' and 'XY-280' though many manufactures use this same design with thier own branding.

You can see the upgrades in action on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLT5eeX4kF4) as well as how to make the modifications to your sponge filter.

All of these models are printed with PETG as it is much more stable over a long time when fully submerged than something like PLA.  I'm sure other filament types would also be fine, though I have not tested them for extended timeframes (year+) like I have with PETG.

The provided stl files are as follows:
| file | usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| sponge-filter-top.stl | The replacement top for the sponge filter |
| sponge-filter-elbow.stl | Optional elbow to direct outflow to the side |
| tube-colar.stl | Optional colar to help make uplift pipe adjustable |
| elbow-adaptor.stl | Optional adaptor to use elbow with adjustable uplift pipe |

## Sponge filter top replacement
If you are going to replace the top of your sponge filter, you will want to print out the 'sponge-filter-top.stl' model.  I print it sitting flat on it's base with supports around the outside flang.

In addition to the printed model, you will also need a short section of rigid airline tubing and an airstone.  I get the [airstone from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08625FMPD).  I also use 3/16" tubing I get off [airline tubing Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8XCDSD).  I cut the tubing to about 3/4" long and press it down into the hole on the side of the sponge filter top.

## Sponge filter elbow
For the elbow, I print the model with the grate facing down on the bed and use organic supports.

## Adjustable uplift pipe
If you want to replace the uplift pipe of the sponge filter, you will need a 20mm tube.  I use the following [20mm tube from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6QB6FY4).  This tube has an outside diameter of 20mm and an inside diameter of 18mm.

If you want to make the adjustable version, you will also need a 18mm tube.  I use this [18mm tube from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6Q6LRBQ).
